# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I had fun with it. I think I'm going to enjoy this course. 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Really well! I schedule regular breaks to stretch, exercise, and get outside in the sunshine.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
I just want to read up on methods so that I know what tools are out there that could be useful. It's like being a mechanic and all the fancy new tools are free, you just need to learn about them.
